## Overview
This folder contains key academic articles related to job satisfaction, workload, and turnover intention in the education sector. The studies employ **Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM)** and, in some cases, **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** to analyze relationships between workplace stressors, job performance, and employee well-being.

## Summary of Articles

### **Anees (2023)**
- Examines the impact of **job stress and workload** on **turnover intention**.
- Finds that **job satisfaction mediates** these relationships.
- Uses **PLS-SEM** for data analysis.
- Suggests future research in different industries and countries.

### **Ortan (2023)**
- Studies **job satisfaction** among **teachers** and its determinants:
  - **Self-efficacy**
  - **Relational aspects** (collaboration, student behavior, management)
  - **Work-related aspects** (teaching tasks, administrative workload)
  - **Working conditions**
- Uses **factor analysis and structural equation modeling** to validate hypotheses.
- Highlights how **a positive work environment reduces burnout and turnover**.

### **Asravor (2023)**
- Analyzes how **work-life balance** affects **job satisfaction** in **tertiary education**.
- Finds that **workplace support** reduces conflicts between work and personal life.
- Recommends prioritizing policies that improve work-life balance.

### **Szromek (2023)**
- Investigates **scientist job satisfaction** and its determinants:
  - **Employment conditions**
  - **Social significance of research**
  - **Work autonomy vs. administrative workload**
- Finds that most researchers feel proud of their scientific work, but **administrative tasks negatively affect job satisfaction**.

### **Sinniah (2023)**
- Explores **job satisfaction and performance** among **Malaysian academics**.
- Uses **PLS-SEM and ANN analysis** to identify key predictors:
  - **Job satisfaction**: Financial rewards, performance appraisal, code of conduct.
  - **Job performance**: Self-efficacy, performance appraisal, code of conduct.
- Recommends **better policies to enhance job satisfaction and performance**.

## Key Takeaways
- **Job satisfaction is influenced by multiple factors**: workload, stress, work-life balance, self-efficacy, financial incentives, and institutional support.
- **PLS-SEM is widely used** to analyze relationships between job stressors and satisfaction.
- **ANN complements traditional models**, helping to identify key predictors of performance and satisfaction.
- **Administrative workload negatively affects job satisfaction**, particularly in academia.
- **Future research should explore additional psychological factors** (e.g., emotional intelligence, mindfulness) and **use mixed-method approaches**.

## 🔍 Next Steps for Data Analysis
To continue studying this dataset effectively, consider:

1. **Applying PLS-SEM**:
   - Use **SmartPLS** or **R’s "plspm" package** to analyze causal relationships.
   - Test **mediation/moderation effects** (e.g., how job satisfaction mediates stress and turnover).

2. **Exploring ANN Techniques**:
   - Use **TensorFlow/Keras** to apply neural networks for predictive modeling.
   - Compare ANN performance with traditional regression models.

3. **Investigating New Variables**:
   - Include **emotional intelligence, self-efficacy, and mindfulness** in future analyses.
   - Test additional mediators/moderators (e.g., workplace policies).

4. **Comparing Industries**:
   - Extend the analysis beyond education (e.g., healthcare, corporate sectors).
   - Evaluate **cross-country differences** in job satisfaction determinants.
