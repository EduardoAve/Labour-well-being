Autonomy and leadership quality: 36 Perceived autonomy and positive work culture, including supportive leadership, are important predictors of job satisfaction and subjective well-being.
Work-life balance: 8 Work-life balance is a significant predictor of job satisfaction in the tertiary education sector.
Demographic and institutional factors: 14 Factors such as age, gender, marital status, caregiving responsibilities, and type of institution can influence job satisfaction and well-being.
Advanced statistical approaches: 510 Studies have used structural equation modeling, machine learning, and other advanced techniques to model the complex relationships between predictors and outcomes like job satisfaction and burnout.
The research also highlights the importance of cross-cultural and cross-regional comparisons 9 to understand how contextual factors may influence the well-being of academic sector workers. Recent empirical studies in European contexts, such as the UK 3, can provide valuable insights for your analysis in Austria and the Czech Republic.
